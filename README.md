# OCR on Hoda Handwritten Numeric Dataset

This project applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to the Hoda handwritten numeric dataset to recognize handwritten digits. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating the steps from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Hoda dataset is a Persian handwritten digit dataset. You can find more details and download it from [Hoda Dataset](https://web.archive.org/web/20200201185337/http://farsiocr.ir/)
- **Source**: Kaggle Link: [Hoda Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/invalizare/hoda-mat)
- **Description**: The dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is a grayscale image of size 32x32 pixels.

## Requirements

Download the dataset from one of that sources mentioned above.
To run the notebook, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
